Tip Form Project

Another JS project done! This was just easier Calculator project. Still, it was done relatively fast,
and with no mistakes. Except that one mistake in which I forgot that I need to add percentage of tip to the 
bill. But still, I think I did it correct (at least I hope -.-   )!

For next JS project, I will try to use querySelectors and to create a function/s that I will pass
to the HTML onclick. Basically, trying other ways in which you can connect functions in JS to event 
listeners and HTML elements.

Onwards to next project!
